In converting PhotoGabble into a Digital Garden from being a traditional Blog with taxonomy made up of Categories I have settled
upon a few distinct content types:

- _[Essays](/essays)_, longform ideas that I am invested in
- _[Noteworthy](/noteworthy)_, interesting things I have found that I want to share
- _[Thoughts](/thoughts)_, quick weakly held ideas on things I haven't fully worked out
- _[Tutorials](/tutorials)_, an attempt at spreading my knowledge
- _[Projects](/projects)_, things that I have worked on
- _[/now](/now)_, a monthly updated list of what I am currently doing

My [Bookshelf](/books) and [/uses](/uses) pages are an exception to the above, my reading
list is imported from <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/user/carbontwelve" title="@carbontwelve@bookwyrm.social">my bookwyrm.social reviews</a>
and the uses page is updated in place as and when I change what technology and devices I use day-to-day.

## Taxonomy
When PhotoGabble had a Blog structure it was organised around posts belonging to one or more category. Since becoming a Digital Garden,
categories have become [Topics](/topic) which to my mind describes the taxonomy better.
