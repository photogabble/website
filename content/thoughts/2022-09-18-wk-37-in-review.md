This week we celebrated another Birthday and spent a day at a children's park called [Four Kingdoms](https://4-kingdoms.co.uk/). We have been to this particular park a few times before and every time I forget how much food they give you when you order a pizza _and_ chips. You see, they don't tell you that the pizza already comes with chips and the order of chips is **huge**.

Aside from the festivities I have been quietly working on my Space Mines Game (see [[PHP Space Mines: Introduction]].) Not a lot of progress, but I have been fleshing out the user interface and settled on a Laravel + Inertia stack.

## Joke of the week
_"I was wondering why this Frisbee kept looking bigger and bigger. And then it hit me!"_
