This week started out by being reminded of the [[Blogtimes, A trip down memory lane|Blogtimes WordPress plugin]]  by [Mike Little's post disussing it being 20 years since he commented on Matt's blog and kicked off the project that became WordPress](https://notacult.social/@mikelittle@mastodon.online/109750328046847753). Matt had ported Blogtimes from b2 to WordPress and this week I continued that tradition and ported it to node as [[Blogtimes for Eleventy]].

Continuing with the theme of reviving old code, I also pulled off the shelf and dusted down [[Tuppence|Tuppence, the PHP pico-framework]] that I last worked on in 2018. Both Tuppence and the boilerplate starter repository have seen some love in the way of updating dependencies and refactoring for PHP8.

The purpose of dusting down Tuppence was so that I might use it to port [botany](https://github.com/jifunks/botany) to PHP and in doing so convert it into a webapp. While I could use Laravel for this, in seeking simplicity in minimalism I wanted to see if I could do so with the bare minimum, which is what a [[Are microframeworks relevant?|microframework]] provides. 

Sometimes it is nice to return to the wild and play with dirt and rocks.
