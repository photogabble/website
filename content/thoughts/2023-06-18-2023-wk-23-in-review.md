It finally happened, I managed to max out the open tabs in Safari on my iPhone. What this has meant is that I needed to do a purge in order for Safari to remain usable and that gave me an opportunity to rediscover some interesting websites.

Much like Łukasz mentions in his article: [The quest for purging my bookmarks](https://offbeatbits.com/the-quest-for-purging-my-bookmarks/), I too need to undertake a major purge in my digital hoard, mostly with the many hundreds of tabs that remain open un-looked at for months, if not years. However, this recent experience on my iPhone was surprising as for almost every tab I remembered why I had opened it _and_ most importantly why I had left it open. [Pardus](https://www.pardus.at/) for example was part of my research for [[Space Mines, Introduction|Space Mines]], it's a similar browser game to [Planetarion](https://www.planetarion.com/) and both are sources of inspiration for my own.

The past six weeks have been an exercise in not getting much #Blogging done; both [April](https://photogabble.co.uk/writing/2023/04/) and [May](https://photogabble.co.uk/writing/2023/05/) saw very little activity from me with regard to writing. I instead worked on Space Mines and rested. Whether this will change in June or July I am unsure. We shall have to see.
