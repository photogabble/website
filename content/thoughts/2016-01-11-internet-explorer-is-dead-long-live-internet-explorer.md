So as it turns out[^1], beginning tomorrow January the 12th 2016, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or technical support for any version of Internet Explorer except for IE11. This effectively means that IE 8, 9 and 10 will be officially obsolete and no longer recieve *any* support from Microsoft.

Depending upon the demographic that your websites target, you might already have dropped support for all but the latest version of IE because it makes good business sense to do so (less development, less testing, less pulling out of hair). However for some of us, especially those targetting international markets[^2], support for browsers as ancient as IE6 is still something that if not being dealt with on a daily basis, is still a concern every so often. 

What this really means from a web developer stand point is if you are only supporting versions of IE that are supported by Microsoft then you can ditch all support exept for version 11. However for the rest of us, it doesn't really change anything until the majority in markets we and our clients target shift to newer browser technologies[^3].

[^2]: Especially in medicine, which is odd.
[^3]: For example, I looked up the stats for one website we manage to see if we could drop IE6 support and discovered to my horror that over 35% where still using IE6 on XP.
