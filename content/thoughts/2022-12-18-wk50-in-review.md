> _"Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday’s code."_

Following on from last week's discovery of [Ramen](https://github.com/BigJk/ramen) I went all in on the library and began following the [TCOD Roguelike Tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) which is written in Python, but why make my life easy?

{% figure "/img/ramen-roguelike-tutorial.png" "The Orc wonders when it will get its turn." "ASCII Roguelike game showing the players @ about to enter a room with an Orc in it." %}

I managed to get up to [part six of the rogue like tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-6/) before the end of the week. You can see the result of this in my [@photogabble/go-roguelike-tutorial repository on GitHub](https://github.com/photogabble/go-roguelike-tutorial). I currently have the code in a broken state due to the refactoring and because it has been a day since I last worked on it, I am not entirely sure why, it's most likely because the refactoring is half complete and things are missing, or pointing to places they shouldn't still be pointing.

## Joke of the week
