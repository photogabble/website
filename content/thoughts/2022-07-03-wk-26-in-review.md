It's that time of the month again; yup time to update my [/now](https://photogabble.co.uk/now/) page with what I am currently doing. For the most part it has remained the same, I am still working on my "Moon Miner" browser game and work on PhotoGabble is as continuous as maintaining a blog can be.

The only difference is that I plan to build out more of my professional brand through Dann Digital, that means putting together some kind of landing page that I can point people to and potentially some kind of portfolio.

This week I joined the [Shifty Coders](https://laravelshift.com/shifty-coders) slack community and worked on a selection of how-to tutorial guides for deploying various software to [Dokku](https://dokku.com/).

Other than that it's been a rather slow week. I haven't read as much as I would have liked and every time I reach for Youtube it's not shown anything that appealed. Roll on Week 27, lets hope it provides more that is worthy of sharing.

## Joke of the week
_"Why did the invisible man turn down the job offer? He couldn't see himself doing it."_
