Another week spent managing the result of a big deployment that went live a few weeks ago. The YouTube algorithm decided to promote films from the [Dollars Trilogy,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollars_Trilogy) so I have spent time watching those, or rather having them in the background while I work. These three movies are said to be pioneering Western's, they certainly fit what I would consider to be the genre. There is something in their colour grading and sets that while depicting a time when life was cheap makes it beautiful and compelling to watch.

I actually looked up *"a time when life was cheap"* thinking that maybe it was a quote from something, it feels like a quote. I didn't find much but I did stumble-upon the Wayne Wang film [Life Is Cheap... But Toilet Paper Is Expensive](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100023/) and after watching its trailer I have added it to my watch list.
