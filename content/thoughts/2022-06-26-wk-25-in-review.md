My big news of the week is that I have finally, somehow come down with Covid. I don't recommend it, anyway on to Week 25 in review:

For a while now I have known of GPT-3 but until reading [this tweet](https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1537849585972006913) by [Brendan Dolan-Gavitt](https://moyix.net/) I wasn't aware of how seemingly clever it has become. I wonder how long it is until we see entire speeches written by GPT-3?

Last week I rediscovered [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) and over the weekend resubscribed for the year because I had been finding its tutorial series on [Inertia SPA techniques](https://laracasts.com/series/inertia-and-spa-techniques) and [Laravel authentication with JetStream](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-authentication-options) very informative.

In "[[Week 24 in review]]" I mentioned using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) with a new Laravel project alongside JetStream. I have continued building that out and have been thoroughly enjoying the process. It could simply be the backend developer in me but being able to write an application in a traditional monolith style while retaining the benefits of SPA feels extremely comfortable.

While thinking about [[The Command Pattern|the command pattern]] and searching GitHub for projects using `namespace App\Actions`, I stumbled upon [Lychee](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee); the self-hosted photo management system written in Laravel. It looks very interesting and I think I will give it a spin next week.

Continuing the topic of Laravel. I recently tried to get the [Laravel Mix, imagemin plugin](https://laravel-mix.com/extensions/imagemin) working only to be faced with:

```
Invalid options object. Copy Plugin has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.
 options[0] should be an object:
   object { patterns, options? }
ValidationError: Invalid options object. Copy Plugin has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.
```

The first search result was this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/CupOfTea696/laravel-mix-imagemin/issues/11) from 2020 which tells me this has been an issue for a while (its now 2022.) Upon investigation I can see from the [Laravel Mix Imagemin npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-mix-imagemin) that it was last worked on three years ago and is therefore no longer in active development.

Digging through the issue thread I found linked a since [archived fork of the Laravel Mix plugin](https://github.com/chiiya/laravel-mix-imagemin) which suggested using [@chiiya/laravel-mix-image-minimizer](https://github.com/chiiya/laravel-mix-image-minimizer) instead.

After a somewhat winding rabbit hole I have come out the end with my projects images being optimised, which is a good result.
