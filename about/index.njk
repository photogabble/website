            I'm a "full stack" web developer from the U.K currently building interesting things with Vue.js, PHP, Golang and Node.
        </p>
        <p>I started playing with computers on an old Toshiba 386 luggable in the mid nineties and have since been making websites for about 21 years.</p>
        <p>My interests include macro photography, vintage computing, astrophysics and game development. I enjoy combining my interests, for example: developing a game for MS-DOS in the C programming language so that I can run it on the 8086 computer I bought on eBay on a whim.</p>
        <p>I can be reached via email but you will likely have better success via either <a href="https://twitter.com/carbontwelve">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://phpc.social/@carbontwelve">Mastodon</a>.</p>

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I have a keen interest in photography, especially Macro, Micro and Landscape photography. Early on in my career between 2008 and 2012 I did Product, Wedding and Event photography professionally. Unfortunately all my photography from that time is locked away on hard drives I have since put in storage. If I ever do get round to digging them out again I will link from here to a gallery of my selected favourites.</p>

        <p>I used to rock a 5D MkII and a 7D MkI with a selection of glass that would impress most photography enthusiasts. Nowerdays I find my iPhone to be good enough for the pot shots I make on a daily basis supplemented with a Canon 70D and 40mm prime lens for family photographs.</p>

        <h2>Folding@Home</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="marginnote">
                <a href="https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/user_summary.php?s=&u=666633">
                    <img src="https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/sigs/sigimage.php?u=666633&t=35947" alt="Folding @ Home"/>
                </a>
            </span>
            For about six years staring from November 2014 I donated spare CPU cycles of computers I used to <a href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@Home</a> this was largely facilitated through the Folding@Home NaCL web client.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately the NaCL client was retired in part due to <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/goodbye-pnacl-hello-webassembly.html">Google deprecating NaCL</a> and while during it's six year lifespan, the NaCl client contributed 48 million Folding@home work units towards the study of human diseases; the only alternatives to date are installed clients that operate natively.</p>
        <p>My desktop computer has been packed away since the birth of our second child, and I don't feel comfortable pushing a heavy thermal load onto my laptop, therefore I haven't been able to contribute any folding cores in just over two years. I do hope to be able to do so again in the future.</p>

            Over the years I have drawn inspiration from many individuals who through their activities have make me want to grow and improve. A handful whom immediately jump to mind are the following:
