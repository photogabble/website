I added this page to keep track of changes to the site over time. In [[2025, Week 31 in Review|August 2025]] I decided to give [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) a go using the same `YY.0W.MICRO` schema that Ubuntu uses.

This website's domain was registered on the 29th of July 2004 making its first version `4.31.0`. The changelog was introduced at `22.35.0` and tracks big site changes, not every single commit.
