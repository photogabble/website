Stubs are the precursor to future content often times little more than a collection of ideas and therefore hidden by default from the rest of this digital garden. Most have been created in order to allow interlinking from other pages via backlinks.

You can think of this list as a schedule of when new content will come out, it's mostly here for me to be able to see what I am working on next.
