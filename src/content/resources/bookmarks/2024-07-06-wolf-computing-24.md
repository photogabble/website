This beautiful #TextMode website is the home of Ollie's [WritChal2024](https://woah.encours.xyz/posts/writchalinfo.html#directory): a yearlong writing challenge. Wolf Computing is set in a fictional far future that sticks to the broad strokes of the [Stars Without Number](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/stars-without-number/products/stars-without-number-revised) lore.

I really love the world building that has gone into the posts, which is only made more realistic by the websites aesthetic.

Absolutely worth a long visit!
