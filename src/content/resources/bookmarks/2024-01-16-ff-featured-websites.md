I discovered this project via the [[ 32-Bit Cafe ]] discord when [[Velvet Boutique|Velvet]] shared it because their website is part of its January 2024 featured list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 17th April this website has entered my [[Digital Graveyard]]. It appears that the project has been taken down for being a "follow for follow" scheme. I do however, think the idea of featuring a selection of websites each month, focusing on those with fewer visitors is a good idea and while in this case the execution was flawed if not disingenuous there does appear to be a need that they were filling.
