I first found Tulip's website from [their Mastodon post, announcing a new 88x31 button](https://mastodon.art/@platinumtulip/113211892709379500). The #DigitalMagpie within me cawed excitedly at their button design and I just had to collect it for my button board!

Their website is new, but already has a number of interesting posts to read, my favourite is [their computer collection](https://platinumtulip.bearblog.dev/my-computer-collection/) for reasons that are obvious if you have browsed my website.
