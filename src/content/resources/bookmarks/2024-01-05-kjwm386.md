kjwm.386 is a Windows 3.1 inspired desktop OS in the browser by [[Ake's corner|Ake]]. I was most interested in it because last year I began porting an old Visual Basic game to the browser and in doing so accidentally went down the [[Rabbit Hole]] of writing a windowing system in JavaScript.

I should finish that port...
