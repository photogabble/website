This website is the reason why I now have a [favourites list](/lists/favourites/)! I first found keri's website through their [post on Mastodon announcing their new 88x31 button](https://pawb.fun/@keeri/113206396524637521) which I found while scrolling through the 88x31 hashtag.

Firstly I love the aesthetic, it's no secret that I love a good #TextMode interface and opening up with an ASCII art logo and an overall monospace font, simply sings to my heart.

The navigation is neatly done, and there are keyboard shortcuts dotted about the pages, which is something I am absolutely going to steal and use here on my own Digital Garden.

This is the kind of website I love to visit, it feels like exploring a grown garden that's been lovingly tended to.
