I discovered Katy's website via the links page of [[Flamed Fury|fLaMEd's website]]; Katy has written a lot of interesting posts making this website a pleasure to explore. With so much interesting content it's difficult to pick a favourite. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading how she produced [generative static art](https://katydecorah.com/code/generative-art/) for her recent redesign and her post titled [Build your metadata library](https://katydecorah.com/code/read/) strikes a chord with me as it describes something I have been trying to do here with PhotoGabble for the past few years.
