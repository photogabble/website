sub_title: A dutiful translation of the on screen episode
---

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this episode of Doctor Who and upon seeing this book available in my local library I snapped at the chance to read more detail than could be shown on screen.

Alas, this is instead a faithful translation of the on-screen episode that while good in its own right provides no additional insight or extra scenes to what could be watched on screen.

It was fun to reimagine the adventure through the medium of a book and having previously watched the episode I was able to imbue the pages with the marvelous performances of David Tennant and Catherine Tate.

While disappointed at the lack of any embellishment upon the original televised episode I did enjoy reading this book.
