![The Serenity ship, a Firefly-class transport, Series 3 spaceship, shown in orbit around an Earth like planet.](/img/films/media/serenity.jpg "_'I am a leaf, on the wind'_")

While at University in the early 2000's I binge-watched every episode of the TV show Firefly, going so far as to watch them more than once and was dismayed when I learned that the show got cancelled. So much so, that in the years since I have chosen not to watch TV series under the expectation that they will be cancelled on a cliffhanger[^1].

Serenity is Firefly's swan song and as disappointing as it was that Firefly was cancelled I am thankful that this Wild West space soap opera made it to the silver screen.

[^1]: Much in the same way as what happened with Farscape, except that eventually got a _final season_.
