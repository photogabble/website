![](/img/films/media/dune-1.jpg "Bum Worms")

No fault to the film itself but I actually only watched half of it in May and didn't get around to finishing the second half until nearly two months later in July. 

I have vague recollection of watching [Lynch's 1984 Dune adaption to film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/) as a young teen when it was shown on Channel Five, many years ago and have yet to read the Dune books by Frank Herbert therefore I had limited knowledge of what this film was about.
