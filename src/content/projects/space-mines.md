In the Summer of 2022 I set about beginning to work on a project that has been on my mind for close to a decade: a modern re-imagination of a rather simple #BASIC game called Space Mines.

Originally published in the [[Computer Spacegames a retrospective|1982 Usborne book: Computer Spacegames]], Space Mines is a rather simple BASIC program consisting of little more than one hundred lines of code. However, something about it captured my imagination and I have ended up using it as my go to **"Hello World"** program for when I am learning a new programming language and have previously discussed [[Porting BASIC Space Mines Game to Go|porting it to Golang]] and [[LDPL Space Mines|LDPL]].

Over the past few years I have started and re-started an attempt to convert this game into a multiplayer browser experience; this has resulted in the creation of multiple projects that get worked upon until I eventually get bogged down, or decide to change track. In 2023, I decided to condense all of my previous attempts into one project and write a realistic roadmap that signposted [[What Finished looks like|the finish line]] to give me achievable goals to go after.
