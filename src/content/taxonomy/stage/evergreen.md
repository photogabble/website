Evergreen content is much like the trees that never drop their leaves in it's always relevant, not based on current events and is just as useful a decade after it was written as on the day it was published. 

Most of the notes found here contains ideas that I have invested considerable time and effort in. These will most likely be [[Essay|essays]] on subjects that I have expert knowledge.
