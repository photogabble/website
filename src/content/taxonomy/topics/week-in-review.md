Called by some as _week notes_, these Week In Review posts list things that I have found interesting that week alongside a short insight into what I did that week.

I treat these as a public diary of sorts, this means they are primarily written to help my future self understand historical context of decisions I have made or what I was working on during a particular time. This is aided by interlinking of notes so that a thread can be followed.
