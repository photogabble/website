title: Tuppence
---

Tuppence is a _very small_ micro framework I wrote in search of programming #Minimalism. It brings together a [powerful PSR-11 dependency injection container](http://container.thephpleague.com/), a [fast PSR-7 router supporting PSR-15 middleware](http://route.thephpleague.com/) and a [simple and effective PSR-14 event dispatcher](http://event.thephpleague.com/3.0/) all provided by _The League of Extraordinary Packages_.

You can read about [[Why I built a tiny PHP Framework called Tuppence|why I wrote Tuppence]], or view the [[Tuppence]] project page for more information.
