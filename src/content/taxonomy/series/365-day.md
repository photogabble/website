This is a writing project that I began in 2019 and was originally housed on [[Wordsmith]] and since moving here it documents my attempts since 2019 to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row and publish it. The rules are simple:

- Write one entry per day
- In my case each entry should be at least 300 words and no more than 800 words, feel free to change this to what you're comfortable with
- Any subject is O.K
- If you miss a day, just make it up another day â€” taking breaks is fine
