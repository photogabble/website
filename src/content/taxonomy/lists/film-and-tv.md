This page was originally inspired by [Visit Branden Higby's movie journal](https://www.higby.io/movie-journal/) which uses [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) as the data source. Not wanting to use a third party service to store my watchlist, I opted for a data file in my 11ty install which I refactored in 2024 to become the [[Movies & TV Shows]] resource section.
