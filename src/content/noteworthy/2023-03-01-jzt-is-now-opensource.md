Back in 2016 I wrote about [[JZT, an awesome homage to the DOS era adventure game ZZT]]; in the years since I have kept an eye on [JZT (jzt.xyz)](http://jzt.xyz/) and played through it a few times. I'm honestly surprised that over the past seven years [Mark McIntyre](https://github.com/markmcintyre) (the guy behind JZT) has continued to work on it, proving updates through a [JZT Community page on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jzt.community)[^1]

On 5th December 2022 Mark posted:

> I'm thinking of open-sourcing JZT this holiday (frankly, it should have been open source from day one). The project started before modern build toolsets, so I'd need to change a few things specific to my environment. Would anyone actually be interested if I were to do this?

Mark then followed up on the 8th January 2023 with "JZT is now open source!" I didn't see this until last month (February 2023) when a near-complete copy of an actual development version of ZZT's source code, dating to June 12th-19th, 1991 was uncovered and published to [asiekierka/almost-of-zzt](https://github.com/asiekierka/almost-of-zzt) by Adrian Siekierka who also so happens to be the author of the [ZZT reconstruction project](https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt): a  reverse-engineered recreation of the source code to the last official release of ZZT (v3.2). News of this reminded me of JZT and hence this post.

In a world of abandoned developer projects (see [[ROMVLVS]]) and prevalent [[Link Rot]] it is nice to see JZT continuing to be developed albeit at a constant glacial pace.
