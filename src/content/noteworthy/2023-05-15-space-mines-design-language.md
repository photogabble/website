Last year I spent a large amount of time researching retro future interfaces and after being heavily inspired by the visual aesthetic and interface design found in the films [Alien (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/), [Outland (1981)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082869/) and [Oblivion (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/) I went to work on my own.

While having never directly worked with one, I have a fondness for amber phosphor displays therefore in creating the games colour palette I went for a shade of orange (`#fc8437`) as the key colour atop a dark grey (`#262626`) with the occasional use of white, salmon (`#ff7b55`) and yellow (`#ffcd4b`) to give some variance.

The interface itself took design elements from all three films but my intent was for it to look as though the player is operating a remote terminal connected to a big iron mainframe; I want the feel of this game to be as though you are sat in the control room of an outpost managing its various systems from the terminal in-front of you â€” turning the lights off and playing in the dark helps but isn't a requirement.

This idea of having a mainframe uplink was one I started working on as far back as 2017 as shown in the above screenshot. Initially I went with a skeuomorphic design limiting the UI to 80 columns by 24 rows with the UI being a traditional ASCII Text User Interface.

I have since moved away from that idea however, as a personal Easter egg my original 2017 code for the above terminal emulation has been ported to a Vue component for use as an animated background on the games landing page.
