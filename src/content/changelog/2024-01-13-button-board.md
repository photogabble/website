In December last year I began exploring the vast expanses of [[ Map of the Indie Web | The Indie Web ]] and in doing so reignited my love of 88x31 button banners and the [[ Button Boards ]] that people display them on. After adding [my own button board](/button-board/) I became a [[Digital Magpie]] and over multiple [[Digital Spelunking]] sessions began filling out my own board with little images that bring me joy.

I have since made it so that a bookmark can have more than one button, with my button board displaying only the first. I also updated the bookmark page to display all the buttons attached to a bookmark entry. 

Adding entries to my button board via the bookmarks has meant that the number of links I have bookmarked increased rapidly and so to aid navigation I added previous / next buttons alongside the current bookmark idx / total.

Occasionally on my digital excursions I would end up in the [digital graveyard](/lists/digital-graveyard/), this also highlighted to me the fact that with a growing number of links I too would soon experience an increasing number of those becoming dead. In response to the inevitable march of entropy I both added the digital graveyard list and a dead link frontmatter flag which tells my template to use the wayback link instead of the cited source url.

In doing so I accidentally began my own digital archiving project, collecting screenshots and 88x31 buttons from long since offline websites into a digital mausoleum of sorts. While exploring I found others who had done similar and added their efforts to my [internet archivers list](/lists/internet-archivers/).

Two of [[♡ cinni''s dream home ♡|Cinni's]] projects: the [[ichigo directory]] and [[the cutie internet archive]] jump to memory as projects taking a similar path to my own but also on the nostalgia section of [[Robyn's Website, Pastel Hell]] where Robyn has collected an impressive number of archived projects and websites from the #OldWeb.

Ultimately I am not aiming to preserve everything I encounter, my button board and bookmarks _only_ include websites that I found interesting either through their content or the buttons that link through to them. It's more a preservation of _my_ experience on the internet, for myself, which may, or may not interest others.
