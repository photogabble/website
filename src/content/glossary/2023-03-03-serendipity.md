**Serendipity** is an unplanned fortunate discovery, the word is also quite possibly my favourite.

My first encounter with the word serendipity was in 2004, there was a shop that used to exist named Serendipity at 51 Upper Thames Walk, Bluewater; a self-described mystical oasis the shop was a favourite destination for some of my friends and always had a cozy, tranquil atmosphere. It survived Bluewater for 12 years before moving to Sevenoaks, although it looks as though they are no longer trading.
