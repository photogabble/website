> Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?"

Going down the rabbit hole is in reference to Alice's adventures in wonderland and how every time I go debugging I feel as though I am falling down a very deep rabbit hole.

Popping on a blue dress and some [programming socks](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/programming-socks) to drop down a rabbit hole isn't mandatory, but it's also not entirely frowned against.
