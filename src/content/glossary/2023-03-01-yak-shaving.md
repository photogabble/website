Do you remember that episode of Malcom in the Middle where Hal has been asked to change a light bulb but when he goes to do so the draw breaks and then in order to fix the draw something else needs fixing which requires he drives to a store and before long he has the car in pieces trying to fix a check engine light — that's Yak Shaving.

According to the [Wiktonary entry for Yak Shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) the phrase was coined by Carlin Vieri in his time at the MIT AI Lab (1993–1998) in reference to a 1991 episode of _The Ren and Stimpy Show_ featuring a segment named "Yak Shaving Day".
