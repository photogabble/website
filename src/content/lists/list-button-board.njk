<p>
    Welcome to my button board, below is a list of websites from my <a href="/resources/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a> which have pretty buttons.
</p>

<nav class="button-board">
    {%- for item in list.items -%}
        {% if not item.data.dead %}
            {% set href = item.data.cite.href or item.url %}
            {% set title = item.data.title %}
            {% set button = item.data.button | firstBtn %}
            {% include "../components/88x31-button-list.njk" %}
        {% endif %}
    {%- endfor -%}
</nav>

<p>
    When I first added this button board it was primarily to include the buttons of websites I had added to my <a href="/resources/bookmarks/">bookmarks</a>; however being the digital magpie that I am I quickly began collecting buttons of long since dead websites, or buttons that don't have a webpage to link to.

<p>
    Some of the below link through to a note giving details of what they used to belong to.

<nav class="button-board">
    {%- for item in list.items | whereKeyEquals('dead', true) -%}
        {% set href = item.url %}
        {% set title = item.data.title %}
        {% set button = item.data.button | firstBtn %}
        {% include "../components/88x31-button-list.njk" %}
    {%- endfor -%}
</nav>
