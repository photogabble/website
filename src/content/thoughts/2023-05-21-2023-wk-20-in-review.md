![[weekly-quote-39]]

This week I spun up a fresh copy of Laravel for [[Space Mines]]. It feels as though I have gone in a large circle on this project; I began working on it in Laravel + Blade, then switched to Nuxt3, then back to Laravel + Inertia.js, then back to Nuxt3 and now finally back to Laravel. However, this time I am taking a leaf out of [Space Traders](https://spacetraders.io/) book and as mentioned [[2023, Week 19 in Review|last week]] will be writing a fully operational API before working on a user agent UI.

In doing so I hope to focus upon the game mechanics and do what I do best: back end code.
