This week began with fighting Prisma to work with a MySQL `DATE` field that contained `0000-00-00` values, this involved finding out that nodemon wasn't actually compiling my changed code and that I had spent an hour trying to fix the issue without any of my changes actually making it to testing.

Given how long this [GitHub issue from 2019 asking for Prisma to support `0000-00-00 00:00:00` for MySQL](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5006) has been open, the official solution can only be assumed to be "deal with it." I dealt with it by converting all zeroed date values to `null` but this isn't ideal, and while I am lucky in being able to transform the legacy database I have inherited, others are not.

Continuing the theme of mild inconveniences, I stumbled into an issue with deploying a Laravel 8 project using [Dokku](https://dokku.com/); every page except for the homepage would return an Nginx 404 error response. It took a good ten minutes of head scratching before determining that it hadn't been caused by any changes I had made since my last deploy, nor by recent updates to the [Heroku PHP Buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php).

Annoyingly it wasn't even a new problem, just one that I hadn't noticed before because up til now the project was a single landing page. The problem was caused by my using `web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx public/` in my `Procfile` instead of `web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/`. Laravel ships with a `.htaccess` file that configures Apache so it can direct all requests to the `public/index.php` file, Nginx doesn't support that config file and so was looking for a `.php` file matching the url and not finding one, thus the 404 response.

A quick fix was switching to using Apache, the [Heroku documentation explains how to set a custom application level Nginx configuration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-php-settings#nginx) and the Laravel docs has an example [Nginx config for directing all requests to your application's `public/index.php` file](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment#nginx). I initially chose Nginx out of habit, I may look into this in more detail, or not. It's working now.
