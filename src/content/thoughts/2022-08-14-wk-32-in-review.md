> _"Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control."_
> — Epictetus

This week has been spent split between a Node.js project and Laravel. The Node project uses [Fasifty](https://www.fastify.io/) with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) to build a service for our routing engine to be hosted on aws lambda.

The project itself is going well, coming from PHP there was a huge shift in mindset needed at the beginning as building for lambda comes with its own constraints. When making requests for example I kept hitting a delay of two seconds before each request would process.

Using the [JavaScript Performance measurement APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html#performance-measurement-apis) I was able to nail this down to the first database query. It's a simple query and ran in about 500ms within [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), even quicker at 23ms once I added an index on the two columns being filtered, so why the ~2000ms delay?

It turns out the delay is the Prisma.js cold boot time. This is compounded by the fact that I am booting Prisma for each request meaning it ends up garbage collected rather than remaining in global scope for all requests to utilise. The solution I have yet to implement is writing a Fastify Plugin to instantiate and expose the Prisma Client instance. The cold boot time will still be there but importantly; it won't be felt by every single request.
