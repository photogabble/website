When I first added my [button board](/button-board/) it was primarily to include the buttons of websites I had added to my [bookmarks](/resources/bookmarks/); however being the digital magpie that I am I quickly began collecting buttons of long since dead websites, or buttons that don't have a webpage to link to.

<nav class="button-board">
    {% render "components/88x31-button-list.njk", button: buttons %}
</nav>
