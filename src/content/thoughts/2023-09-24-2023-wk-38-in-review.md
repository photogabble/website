![[weekly-quote-57]]

I spent my time this week playing Stardew Valley and found [[Stardew Valley Crop Planner|this rather helpful crop planner tool]] which I have since used to great success. I did unfortunately however fall into the trap of min-maxing the game and have now played the entirety of the first month ten times over.

The past month or so have flown past and looking at PhotoGabble I can see I haven't written much in seven weeks! Having a fortnight holiday made me out of sync with my publishing schedule and it all kind of snowballed from there. I have still written multiple articles, but none are in a publishable state.

This weekend I'm taking the family to **Lego Land**, I might never financially recover.
