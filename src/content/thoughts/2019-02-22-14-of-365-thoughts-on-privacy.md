This is day fourteen of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row.

I recently had a discussion with my father around the whole privacy vs "I have nothing to hide," discussion going on at the moment, and he gave me an interesting insight.

Forty years ago the notion that your government would intercept, open _and_ read every item of mail posted to every home in the country would have had the public and the media up in arms, condemning in unison the very obvious government over-reach and the dangers it presents.

Yet here we are today with government schemes such as the international [Five Eyes signals intelligence alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) making automated un-targeted intrusions en-mass that are essentially identical in nature to having every item of post opened, read and documented; and the public seem ambivalent at best and complacent at worst.
