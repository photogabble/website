This week I said goodbye to my Toyota Yaris, it was the car we brought our eldest home from Hospital in, that went on adventures around the New Forrest and eventually became relegated to a daily commuter when I worked in Winchester.

Since the beginning of the pandemic it had sat almost entirely dormant, taking up space on our driveway. So dormant that its battery discharged to the point that when I stalled in a drive through it refused to turn over the engine.

Now that I am full time remote having more than one car is a decadence that we should no longer afford and so it's been sold to one of those "we buy any car" internet companies.

My Birthday was this weekend and in celebration we met my parents at the [Milestones Living History Museum](https://www.milestonesmuseum.org.uk/) in Basingstoke. Serendipitously it also happened to be the same day that a Steam Punk event was happening there which made the day even more fun!

## Joke of the week
