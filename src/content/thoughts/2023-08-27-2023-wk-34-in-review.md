![[weekly-quote-53]]

I spent this week on holiday at my parents house. They live by the sea, this meant I spent most of this week at the beach and not doing project work. I did however find time to read ![[ Why htmx Does Not Have a Build Step | Why htmx Does Not Have a Build Step ]]. htmx looks interesting, I want to learn more about it.
