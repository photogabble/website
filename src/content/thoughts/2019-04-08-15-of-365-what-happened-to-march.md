This is day fifteen of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row.

â€”

For those of you who may have been following along I vanished from most online spaces for some of February and the majority of March.

There are a few reasons for such a long hiatus, and they all add up to "life happens," mostly in the shape of fire-fighting a project with a tight deadline at work that resulted in a few 80-100hr work weeks in order to get everything done. Between that and family commitments it left very little in the way of free time for social media and my personal projects.

Now that the deadline has been met and things have returned to normal I am back. My 365 writing project took quite a hit, but I will now attempt to write something every day.

Let's see if I can *at least* get a ten-day streak!
