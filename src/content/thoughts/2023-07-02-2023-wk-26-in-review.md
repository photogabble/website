This week at work we opened pandoras box with a large, all encompassing deployment that has so far had a week's worth of fallout. This was both planned for and expected but it has been quite exhausting keeping up with the amount of support tickets and finding bugs in different services that had unforeseen and sometimes mysterious knock on issues.

I did however get some more work done on [[Rebuild The Kabal Invasion|rebuilding The Kabal Invasion]] most notable being the encounters system and API.
