I spent the whole of last week (_wk33_) on holiday in Herne Bay. While I did bring my laptop with me, I didn't make much use of it beyond playing Minecraft for a few hours.

This week at work I have jumped back into working on our growing mono-repo which means more TypeScript and Prisma.js _fun_. Speaking of Prisma, there was activity on [issue #5006: Support `0000-00-00 00:00:00` for MySQL](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5006) with two people providing similar solutions to the problem of Prisma.js crashing on [MySQL zero dates](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date).

The [first approach](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5006#issuecomment-1221208681) by [ChrisM3y](https://github.com/ChrisM3y) is using a `preManipulationHook` function to set any zero dates to `now()`. There are three key problems with this approach:

- The `preManipulationHook` must be run before each `SELECT` query on a problematic table adding overhead
- A zero date value can be considered as unset, setting it to an arbitrary value errases that information
- The date column can have importance, a zero date for the column `booked_in_at` can mean the booking has yet to be made, updating that to an arbitrary value will cause undesirable side effects

The [second and most recent solution](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5006#issuecomment-1224036491) provided by [bjih1999](https://github.com/bjih1999) invokes the usage of [MySQL generated columns](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-generated-columns.html) to create a virtual column that is `DateTime|null`.

This is an eloquent solution to the problem, not ideal but good as a stop-gap measure; however, the problem of having zero date fields largely raises its ugly head in large legacy databases, these tend to have a lot of rows to which any alterations to the schema comes at a cost of locking the table for a period of time - therefore often is the case that schema changes have to go through approval processes and be planned to ensure downtime is either mitigated or constrained.
