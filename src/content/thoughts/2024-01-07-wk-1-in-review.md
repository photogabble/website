![[weekly-quote-74]]

It's a fresh week, a New Year and like many office workers in the UK I am back to work after almost two weeks leave.

This week I read a few peoples end of year reviews: [John Wargo's 2023 wrap up](https://johnwargo.com/posts/2023/end-of-the-year-2023/), [Cassidy William's Bye Bye 2023](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/bye-bye-2023/) and [Jeremy Keith's 2023 in numbers](https://adactio.com/journal/20750) to name but a few that stood out; this prompted me to write my own [[Goodbye 2023|goodbye to 2023]] which I think few people will read but might be interesting to my future self some day.

This year I have jumped into the #SmallWeb with both feet and ended up in multiple hours long [[Digital Spelunking]] sessions that have resulted in expanding my [button board](https://photogabble.co.uk/button-board) several times over. While not as extensive as some [88x31 Button Collections](https://photogabble.co.uk/lists/88x31-collection/) I have realised that I am quite the [[Digital Magpie]], if your website has a 88x31 button I find pretty I will not be able to resist adding it to my button board.

Around this time last year I stumbled upon [Brandur's website](https://brandur.org/) and really liked their homepage layout displaying a single photo from their gallery, I'm unsure if its sourced from their  [Sequences project](https://brandur.org/sequences) but I felt inspired by both ideas and would like to add similar to my website.

PhotoGabble started as a photo gallery and portfolio website for my university entrance submission, therefore adding a photography section will be a homage to the domains roots.

Continuing on the theme of photography and inspired by Rob Allan's [2023 in pictures](https://akrabat.com/2023-in-pictures/) i'd like to be able to write my own "*year in pictures*" at the end of 2024; having a small yet manageable photography projects like Brandur's Sequences might be the way to go.

Seems it might be time to dust off my dSLR and begin taking some snaps!
