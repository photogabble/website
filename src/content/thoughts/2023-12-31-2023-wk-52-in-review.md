![[weekly-quote-73]]

It's the **last week** of the year! 2023 went *very* quickly, and it feels as though I didn't get a lot done; I did however begin a number of side projects, none of which made it past MVP let alone across the finish line. I'll probably write a short year in review where I go over each project and decide if it makes the cut to 2024.

As I write this I also have sixteen weeks of this year's week in review drafted and yet unpublished. They are all mostly completed but its indicative of how little free time I have had these past few months, unlike regular posts (of which there have also been few), the weeks in review require a lot more work in getting the bookmarks into the repo and ready for publishing. Back in November I tried out a couple of headless CMSs in the hope that they would lessen that burden however, none of them actually seemed to meet the cut.

Sorting out [[My publishing workflow]] is going to be something that I need to work on in January if only to make it so I don't end up with such a massive backlog this time next year.

This week I [[Porting a 30 year old BASIC game to Go|ported a 30 year old BASIC game, Business Management to Go]], this is something I had done a number of years ago when I [[Porting BASIC Space Mines Game to Go|ported the BASIC space mines game to Go]] and is going to become something of an ongoing project for 2024. I already wrote in conclusion of this weeks porting adventure that I want to extend the game and eventually merge it with the Space Mines game I ported previously, these extensions will provide plenty of content fodder for the coming months.

I serendipitously stumbled upon [Marks port of Lost Treasure](https://mysticdungeon.club/losttreasure/), another game from the same [[Stimulating simulations]] book that *Business Management* came from. Inspired by Mark making the text game look visually interesting I decided to give it a go myself, in doing so I also dusted off my [scene director](https://github.com/go-rogue/scenes) library and wrote an [[Example usage of my Golang Scene Director package|example usage of it]].

Onwards to 2024.
