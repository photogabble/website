This week's [[Rabbit Hole|adventure in wonderland]] was largely spent learning about font subsetting; eventually culminating in me writing a small plugin for #11ty to create highly cut down versions of the [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) font for use on this website. I'm currently in the process of writing about that (*see [[Update font]] once complete*) but the meat of it is I went from having multiple MB of font files down to just under 100KB in total for the four fontsets that I use.

Alongside that adventure and as part of seeking [[Inbox Zero]] I rediscovered that the IMAP extension for #PHP causes it to hang on the console. This seems to be a known issue with the extension with a closed issue from 2020 giving [a potential solution to IMAP hanging after installing the IMAP extension](https://github.com/kabel/homebrew-php-ext/issues/24) : adding the hostname to `/etc/hosts` is a potential solution.

I tried this out and it worked! However, I am honestly surprised that nowhere other than that GitHub issue could I find a solution nor an explanation as to why. I had a quick look at the extension's [php_imap.c source code](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/imap/php_imap.c), but I think the hostname DNS query is being prompted by an upstream dependency instead of the extension itself.

Online it appears there has been a lot of drama related to GPT-3 and Bing; Simon Willison has a great writeup in their post [Bing: "I will not harm you unless you harm me first"](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/) and Khari Johnson's [Chatbots Got Big—and Their Ethical Red Flags Got Bigger](https://www.wired.com/story/chatbots-got-big-and-their-ethical-red-flags-got-bigger/) for Wired sums up my thoughts nicely.

## Joke of the week
_"Don't be worried about your smartphone and television collecting your data... Your vacuum has been gathering dirt on you for years now."_
