![[weekly-quote-42]]

A few weeks back in my [[2023, Week 19 in Review]] I mentioned that I was looking forward to watching Frances Buontempo's lecture [What is a random number and why should I care?](https://conference.accu.org/en/accu2023/public/events/15). It would appear that the [ACCU Conference YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ACCUConf/videos) have begun releasing the videos from this Aprils conference over the past two weeks at a rate of one a day. Frances' lecture isn't yet live but I should be able to watch it soon.

This week has been almost entirely consumed by a big deployment at work of a project that has been three years in the making. It unfortunately once again hit a roadblock with a bug in an upstream service this new feature depends upon and so after a marathon week it's culminated in a sense of frustration and deflation. So close, and yet.
