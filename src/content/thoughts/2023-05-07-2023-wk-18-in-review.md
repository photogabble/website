![[weekly-quote-37]]

Here in the UK it has been a [[Bank Holiday | Bank Holiday week]] which meant the majority of people in the UK had Monday off work. We spent ours taking our children to [Moors Valley](https://moors-valley.co.uk/), a huge country park and forest within the New Forest that has a number of outdoor activities but most importantly to those of us with small children, several large play areas and an impressive narrow-gauge railway both of which make it well worth a day out to us.

This time however we decided to do something that we hadn't done before and rented bikes. Our eldest got her own bike attached as a tandem to mine while Debs had the youngest in a children's seat on the back of her bike. Up until now I hadn't ridden a bike for at least three years, I was surprised at how quickly I got back into it. We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience, it's something I would recommend and look forward to doing again.

A large percentage of my free time this week has been spent working on #SpaceMines and learning #ThreeJS. I think I might have gone down a bit of a [[Rabbit Hole]] with #ProceduralGeneration of planet textures. I want to be able to generate a visually interesting player map that looks a lot like the Pluto surface images from [New Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html).

With my recent addition of [Resources](https://photogabble.co.uk/resources/) to PhotoGabble I feel as though I might have  complicated my [[My publishing workflow|publishing workflow]] because now for these Weeks in Review I need to create a file for the joke of the week another for the quote and a file for each of the links that I wish to keep as [bookmarks](https://photogabble.co.uk/resources/bookmarks/). In an attempt to simply things I ended up [[Adding a  "make" command to my 11ty install | adding a "make" command to my 11ty install]] during which I discovered and used the [cheerio.js library](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) for parsing and manipulating HTML.
