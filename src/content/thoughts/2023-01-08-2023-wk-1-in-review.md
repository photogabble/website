The week before Christmas I put my laptop away and boxed up my office in anticipation for installing my new office desk, thus started a multi-week break from work as the carpenter I had engaged with to work on the desk didn't deliver it until January the second.

It feels weird to finally be back online and nice to _finally_ have my office finished. I have spent the majority of this first week of the year back at work deep into AWS CDK shenanigans, working out what we need to do in order to automate our deployment.

Before now, I had never used the AWS CDK and to begin with it was quite intimidating however I did have an excellent starting platform as someone had written a lot of boilerplate before handing the project over to me.

In the following weeks I will be deploying a massive feature that has had over a year of almost continuous work put into it. It's likely to be a bumpy ride, however at least I will know that the CI/CD side of things is going to be rock solid.

## Joke of the week
> **Question**: Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?
> **Answer**: Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!
