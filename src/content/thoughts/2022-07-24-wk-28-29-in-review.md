Normally I begin writing these weeks in review about halfway through the week, however last week's review for week 28 was not even begun by the time Sunday rolled round. With only a few notable things to share and not even a terrible dad joke found I decided to roll week 28 into week 29 rather than rush out something that would have been lackluster to read.

This week kicked off with the worst heatwave my country has had in decades, this naturally resulted in my office reaching a high of 36°C. We have no air conditioning here so the two days of _extreme_ heat where brutal, but we got through in one piece and by Thursday it was a more reasonable 22°C outside.

It's funny how our bodies quickly acclimatise to the heat, here 22°C is shorts and t-shirt weather but after the heatwave I found myself wrapping up warm in thick hoodies and leggings.

Much like last week, I have been super busy working on personal projects which have consumed a lot of my available free time. I hope to be more free next week for other activities but until I get these deployed it's a race to the finish line.
