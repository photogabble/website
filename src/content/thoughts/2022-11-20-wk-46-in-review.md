I have continued last week's [[2022 Week 43 to 45 in Review|trip down memory lane]] with a prolonged deep dive; having rediscovered [City Simulator by Dave Katrowski](https://github.com/Planet-Source-Code/dave-katrowski-city-simulator-partial__1-11216) I ended up cosplaying as Alice and following the white rabbit to see how deep its [[Rabbit Hole|rabbit hole]] goes; that is to say, I pulled down a local copy of the Visual Basic 6.0 source code and installed [Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 sourced from the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/microsoftvisualstudio60) into a virtual machine running [Windows 98 Second Edition, also sourced from the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/windows-98-se-isofile) and began tinkering.

All too soon I remembered the first time I did this and thought it would be a fun exercise to port the Visual Basic source to TypeScript in order to run the game in the browser. While doing so I discovered [98.css, a design system for building faithful recreations of Windows 98 UIs](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) and so the rabbit hole deepened. I had accidentally nerd-sniped myself into building a Windows 98 themed windowing system in the browser.
