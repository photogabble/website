![[weekly-quote-40]]

Wow I am running behind on these weeks in review! I currently have the previous three weeks drafted, let's see if I get them published before this one goes live? (You're in the future when I write this, did I do it?)

This week I mostly worked on my [[Space Mines]] project; after last months [[Rabbit Hole]] of Nuxt3 and reviving all my original attempts at getting this project off the ground I have ended up going back to what I know: #PHP and #Laravel.

I'll eventually get #LaravelJetstream involved in this project but for now I am working on getting all the core game mechanics complete and a working API. One piece of functionality I am quite proud of is having a `Building` model that is able to become one of its siblings based upon its records `kind` enum value. This is done via overloading Eloquents `newFromBuilder` and `newInstance` methods with ones that check the building type and construct the new instance based upon their set class.

This nifty trick allows me to use the base `Building` class for getting all buildings in a player's outpost, while the resulting collection will be a mix of all the inheriting building subclasses. I'm then sprinkling those classes with interfaces for `HasInventory`, `CanHarvest`, `HasCrew` and so on which allow differentiation of functionality between the various buildings.

I'll be writing about this in more detail within [[Space Mines, 2023 May Devlog]].
