Began watching [SharkyGames Stardew Valley competitive multiplayer series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI6McWj_yY4&list=PLD80Qg5W0W_lbdiXMBk36opaeRfxGeu5p) which got me back into playing Stardew Vally. I last played the game in 2018 and had bought it on my Nintendo Switch during the pandemic lockdown years but never made time to give it a go. I don't often have enough time to dedicate to a long gaming session but the switch can be picked up and put down often and so I finally got back into playing Stardew Vally; thanks Sharky and Poxial!

Our eldest daughter has for a long time been into Minecraft and this week I introduced her to [GeminiTay's new Hardcore 1.20 Minecraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4vtrzcqyg0&list=PLfim1Ac_MuxZf-jeoGLrt-9khcnIPVtHY) which she absolutely loves. I have also bought Minecraft for the Switch so that she can play it as well. We do play it on the PC together but I feel as though the Switch controls will be easier for her to master as the keyboard and mouse are still quite intimidating.
