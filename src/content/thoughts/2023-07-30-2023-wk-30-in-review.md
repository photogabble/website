![[weekly-quote-49]]

This week was spent at Butlins with family on holiday therefore I was almost entirely disconnected from the internet except from a few hours spread over the week when I mostly browsed cool things people where sharing on Discord.

Work on [[Rebuild The Kabal Invasion|rebuilding The Kabal Invasion]] had been paused last week and will likely not resume until after next week as I would like to work on this website a little and ideally get the lists functionality completed that I began in the background a few weeks back.

The list functionality itself was quite easy to write, it has however lead me down the [[Rabbit Hole]] of refactoring the nearly 1000 lines of my `links.js` data file into separate bookmark `.md` files each with appropriate notes as to why I have bookmarked them. I have been able to get half the work done so far, I might launch with it half done as it's a blocker on getting other things completed and does not negatively impact the website as a whole if I keep the original blogroll page in place for the time being.

As part of my research for my yet to be published essay: *[[Where did all the Webrings go?]]* I discovered the [XXIIVV Web Ring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) and subsequently added a link to it in the footer of all my pages. That was *over* a year ago, so it is about time I opened a [PR on the XXIIVV project to add PhotoGabble](https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring/pull/810) to the Web Ring's index officially. I opened that last week, but I don't expect it to be merged before I get home from Holiday.
