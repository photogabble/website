This is day thirteen of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row.

â€”

Yesterday I wrote about [[12 of 365, What sparks joy?|what sparks joy]] and a while before that [[4 of 365, it's a van life for me?|is it a van life for me?]]; both posts share the theme of minimalist living and divulge a deep yearning for a much simpler life.

I think that to some degree we all share a common want for simpler, less cluttered living free from the many constant pressures of modern life while also benefiting from the positive aspects that modern life can bring. While that does sound a little like having your cake and eating it too it's _easily_ achievable within the framework of tiny homes and the [tiny living movement](https://thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/).

Tiny homes (100 to 400sqft) have the potential to be less cluttered and due to their relative cheapness in comparison to a traditional home they also come with far less financial pressure often being cheap enough to be paid off in less than ten years.

My dream is to obtain a few acres of land where I can build a tiny home, I know it will not be easy, it will take a long time.
