The Queens funeral was this week making the 19th a public holiday. I haven't paid the Royal Family much attention and find the tabloids focus on them disgusting at best. I don't have much to say about the matter, the Queen lived a life full of privilege and adventure under constant unyielding scrutiny from millions who wished her harm. She will be missed by many and my condolences to her friends and family.

Thanks due to unintentionally nerd-sniping myself I have spent a fair amount of time this week researching how to procedurally generate mountain ranges. This lead me to [Nick McDonald's](https://nickmcd.me) geomorphology simulator: [SoilMachine](https://github.com/weigert/SoilMachine). I loved the feel of one of Nick's example outputs from his simulator and wanted to write a generator based upon SoilMachine that could procedurally generate terrain of the same aesthetic infinitely in the (x,y) planes for use with my Space Mines game.

## Joke of the week
