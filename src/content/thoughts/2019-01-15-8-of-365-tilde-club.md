This is day eight of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row.

â€”

I thought it was only just last year (2018) or the year before that when I learned about [[tilde.club]]. It was actually 2014 via [this](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf) article by Paul Ford on Medium that documents Pauls _accidental_ creation of the ~Tilde network within which I first learnt of their existence.

Today's post is inspired by [this toot](https://anticapitalist.party/@dirtycommo/101419705169052865) by [@dirtycommo](https://anticapitalist.party/@dirtycommo) on their ~Tilde club [nand.club](http://nand.club).

While I am not old enough to have enjoyed the BBS networks of the late 80s to early 90s or the vibrant technology home-brew scene. I do get pangs of nostalgia at the thought of low-tech online communities of people working together. It's for that reason why I believe ~Tilde clubs resonate with me on a personal level. They _are_ small, vibrant communities made up of people from many different geological locations and social backgrounds. You could say ~Tilde is a BBS renaissance, albeit sadly a small one.

There are [several other ~Tilde clubs](http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/othertildes.html) that have sprouted up since Paul's creation of tilde.club (with a few similar projects that had been around in the years before.) Their creation speaks to me a shared feeling of people wanting to work together, people wanting to build a community. We are after all a social species.

The _Fediverse_ and the ever-increasing list of software that interoperates with it, while not a ~Tilde club, speaks the same energy of community building. Of providing a space where people can communicate with one another, build things, share and come together to build something better than the sum of its parts.

In many ways my creation of [Wordsmith](https://wordsmith.social) shares that narrative. Wordsmith isn't a ~Tilde club, it is a privacy-first publishing platform that communicates with the Fediverse. I want Wordsmith to become a vibrant community, full of interaction between creators as they use it to publish their essays, poetry, articles, stories, notes or anything at all.

Much like a ~Tilde club Wordsmith is dependant upon me to keep it operational, however unlike a ~Tilde club I am also dependant upon the [Write Freely](https://writefreely.org/) project spearheaded by a single developer: [Matt Baer](https://write.as/matt/who-is-this).

I have high hopes that Matt will drive Write Freely in a direction that is in line with how I see Wordsmith growing, however if at some point in the future those ideologies diverge I am not against forking the project and writing the features myself.
