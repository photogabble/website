The majority of this week was spent building out two fresh Nuxt3 applications one for work and one for my #SpaceMines project. In both cases I needed to build in user sessions. For work the Nuxt application is interfacing with an existing monolith and so only needs to request a session bearer token on authentication and use that for all future api requests — nice and simple.

For Space Mines I had the idea of using Mastodon as the authentication server via its Oauth2 mechanism. This worked surprisingly well and wasn't nearly as difficult as I had been lead to believe from other Oauth nightmare stories. This is something I plan on writing about in the near future, it's on my list of things to do.
