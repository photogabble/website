> _"You're only given one little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."_
> — Robin Williams

This week has absolutely flown past, looking back it feels as though I went to bed on Monday night and woke up part way into Friday!

I didn't manage to meet any of my publishing goals. However, I did do a lot of maintenance on this digital garden; revamping its footer, adding a new concept of lists and refactoring layouts.

I begin an interesting project next week involving Nuxt3 and porting across some of our existing workflows to it as way of upgrading our stack to something more modern. A lot of our legacy code is Vue2, I am hopeful that it will not be too difficult to copy and refactor to get working.

## Joke of the week
> Struggling to think of what to buy someone for Christmas?
> Get theme a fridge and watch their face light up when they open it.
