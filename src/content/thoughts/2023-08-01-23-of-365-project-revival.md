This is day twenty-three of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row; the project paused in December 2019, this is a **revival**.

â€”

I [[1 of 365, The Spark|began this 365 day project]] with the intent of actually completing a short article once per day for the whole of 2019; and as you can see we are now in August 2023 and this is post twenty-three!

That isn't to say that the project is a failure, I do have a drafts folder stuffed full of half finished essays, articles, poems and the like. I just didn't _like_ any of them enough to hit that publish button, which is kind of against the spirit of the project itself.

> The 365-day writing challenge is supposed to inspire creative writing

The project began as a way to get myself back into writing at a time when by website was down and a revival was at least two years away from fruition[^1]. At the beginning I gave myself a handful of loose rules to follow:

- Write one entry per day
- Each entry should be _at least_ 300 words and no more than 800 words, feel free to change this to what you're comfortable with
- Any subject is O.K
- If you miss a day, just make it up another day - taking breaks is fine

After an initial streak of eight posts in a row I broke rule one, not posting again for almost a month and rather inconstantly throughout the rest of 2019 thereafter; this was mostly due to work commitments combined with the birth of our youngest, bringing a fresh baby into the world is hard work so I can't be too hard on myself

Weirdly enough I didn't post another entry after [[22 of 365, Grievances with WriteFreely|highlighting my grievances with the WriteFreely project]]. It's almost as though some world changing event happened in 2020; all joking aside the pandemic is honestly almost entirely the reason for a gigantic hole in my publishing schedule from 2020 through to 2022. It's not that I didn't have stories to tell, thoughts to share and words to type but as many others during that time I was unable to do much other that tread water; all side quests where put on hold.

â€”

That is not to say that I stopped writing entirely; there are a good two dozen drafts in various forms of completion with all but two being [[Evergreen Content|evergreen]] subjects. Now 1,328 days after my last post I am reviving the project and will be using these posts as a starting point.

I have gone through all 22 previous posts and updated their preface to track the streaks and will likely be writing some functionality into this website to track that for me.

This time I will endeavour to keep the posting consistent. Time will tell if that pans out.

[^1]: It didn't feel that long, and surprisingly I didn't write about the revival in 2022 but there is a huge gap in blog posts from 2018-2022 with 2019 mostly filled by this 365 day project posted on Wordsmith due to PhotoGabble being down.
