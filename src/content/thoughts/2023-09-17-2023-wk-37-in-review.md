In continuation of [[2023, Week 36 in Review|last week]] I played a lot of Stardew Valley, wrote a guide based upon Poxial's video [The ULTIMATE Year 1 Guide to Stardew Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-U-gLvlMz8) which I discovered through their [100 Days of Stardew Valley, Poxial VS Sharky!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxktKYO_vQA) video after having binge-watched Poxials entire series on their 100-day challenge.

Watched [Pretty Average Sized Farm - The Full Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52MwZ1F6TmU) by Waligug, I love the idea of constraining the build area to ~300 tiles and am impressed at how well they did.

I discovered the game [[ Vintage Story ]] and while I don't have time to dedicate to playing it right now, there are a couple of play-throughs on YouTube that I might find time to watch in five minute blocks here and there.
