February has been a surprisingly busy month! I didn't get half the writing I wanted to get done however I did write two (*as yet unpublished*) #11ty plugins, one for [[Font Subsetting with Eleventy.js|automated font subsetting]] and the other for adding Obsidian style wikilinks, backlinks and embeds.

This week I rediscovered the [Mighty Car Mods YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/mightycarmods) with their Worlds Fastest Midget series; I never stopped liking their content but YouTube in its infinite wizdom stopped promoting them to me. Since I started skipping the homepage and only intentionally visiting my subscribed feed I have begun rediscovering channels I hadn't watched in years!

Continuing onward from last week's implementation of font subsetting, this week I rewrote my #WikiLinks implementation into a new [[Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin]]. This was made possible thanks to several additions to v2 of #11ty: the as yet undocumented `RenderManager` class that exposes the eleventy.js template engine for arbitrary programmatic use and the `amendLibrary` method that has been recently added to the Configuration API.

I'll be tidying this up and publishing it at some point in March.

## Joke of the week

## Notable Videos Watched
- [**Behind The Mistakes**: The Hellcorder; World's First Recorder Based Guitar Amplifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuB2tH-wnXY), **spoiler**: it doesn't sound very good at the moment but is a technical feat in and of itself!

I was aware of [Intels 4-bit 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) and this video had me interested enough to look for more esoteric processors[^1]
- [**Sebastian Lague**: Coding Adventure: Hydraulic Erosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaXk97ujbPQ), back in my [[2022, Weeks 40 to 42 in Review]] I described going down a very deep [[Rabbit Hole|rabbit hole]] in regard to [Soil Machine](https://github.com/weigert/SoilMachine). In Sebastian's video he describes in visual detail how to program *Hydraulic Erosion*, and it's inspired me to look more into this
