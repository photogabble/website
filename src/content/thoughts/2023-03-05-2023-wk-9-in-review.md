In [[2023, Week 8 in Review|last weeks review]] I shared [Sebastian Lague's video on Hydraulic Errosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaXk97ujbPQ), a subject I fell into a deep rabbit hole with [[2022, Weeks 40 to 42 in Review|late last year]]. This week I published about [[ROMVLVS]] a nifty looking TextMode Civ game that I thought had been abandoned and lost to the sands of time; soon after publishing however, [@vga256](https://dialup.cafe/@vga256) messaged me with a link to a very much alive and active [ROMVLVS Project Page](https://keepitwiel.github.io/romvlvs/romvlvs.html) with the most recent update published in 2019!

It turns out the author had changed their username and my brief glance over their Reddit posts had missed that. I thought I would check out their GitHub Profile and found that they had written their own [Hydraulic Errosion Simulator](https://github.com/keepitwiel/hydraulic-erosion-simulator); this is pure serendipity!

A big thank you to @vga256, you should most certainly check out their [Multimedia HyperGuide Podcast](https://podcast.vga256.com/) it makes for excellent listening if you're into Retro Computing.

In other news I published my [[Eleventy.js Font Subsetting Plugin]] which has been about a month in the making. The code was completed in early February but I had been too busy to tidy it for public release. Similarly, my [[Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin]] will be published within the next week.

Finally, I chipped a molar tooth on Sunday; the dentist fitted me in on Monday for an emergency repair, unfortunately it chipped off by Wednesday evening. Seems I am going to need an expensive procedure to make a permanent repair. At least it's no longer painful, however it is super sensitive.

## Joke of the week
