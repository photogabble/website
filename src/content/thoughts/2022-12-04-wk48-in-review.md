It feels as though November has come and gone in a matter of days, seriously where did it go? These weeks in review have helped me remember what I have been doing week to week, mostly tinkering with #RetroGaming in porting decade old code to #TypeScript and giving it a new lease of life. However, I haven't really been writing a lot else outside these end of week retrospectives.

The idea of these weeks in review series is ultimately to give me something easy to write while also keeping a lot of notable things that I might want to revisit some day down the line. It shouldn't however be the only thing I write.

I don't know if that will change any time soon, I should write up about the hand full of projects I have been working on in the evenings, but they feel too unfinished themselves for me to write about them in any great detail outside these end of weeks.
