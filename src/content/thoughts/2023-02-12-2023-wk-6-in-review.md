This week Jet Brains sent me a [price increase notification for the Laravel Idea plugin](https://laravel-idea.com/blog/2023/price-increasing). This is a third party plugin by Adel Faizrakhmanov and that link will take you to their post explaining that up until now the plugin had been developed by a single person as a side project and had now become unsustainable. In open source software this is a story as old as time however this isn't open source and Adel wishes to continue developing the plugin. In order to do so they will be creating a company with the intent to hire at least one or two developers to relieve the burden.

I fully support Adel's decision. Their [Laravel Idea plugin](https://laravel-idea.com/) has proved itself time and time again to be incredibly helpful and certainly worth the $39 I paid last year. The price is *only* increasing this time by $10 to $49 for the first year, with the usual 20%/40% discounts for second/third+ years. Whether we will see an additional price increase in the future is yet to be determined.

Beyond researching for my #OldWeb series of posts, I haven't done a lot else this week. I dug deep into my notebooks going back as far as 2017 and was suprised to see so much [[Link Rot]] after only a couple of years!

For example: [[ROMVLVS]] a Text Mode Civilization/SimCity crossover that I found via a post in the **/r/roguelikes** sub-reddit has seemingly been wiped from the internet. Not only does the Tumblr dev blog no longer exist but the GitHub repository has been deleted as well.

ROMVLVS was just a developer side project that probably ended up on the [[digital graveyard]] like so many other side projects. I was interested in it because the single screenshot I had seen looked visually beautiful albeit entirely #TextMode.

Following that [[Rabbit Hole]] ended up with me spending several hours researching the two [[Lost Smiley ASCII DOS Games]] by Henry Truong that I last played in 1999. I reached out to @vga256 on [[The Fediverse]] with [this message](https://notacult.social/@carbontwelve/109797530218729383) and the subsequent back and forth resulted in them managing to dig out a screenshot, which I had up until now not seen in over ten years!

I followed that up with the following post:

> I wonder if someone familiar with the [#FidoNet](https://notacult.social/tags/FidoNet) of old, if it's possible to find a zip file that might have been on a [#BBS](https://notacult.social/tags/BBS) in 1999?

This also gathered a lot of people helping, but unfortunately no fresh leads. I think my next course of action will be contacting [Darren Hewer](https://darrenhewer.com/) the author of [dosgames.com](https://www.dosgames.com) and researching other dos game archives both present and shuttered to see if I can find someone else who re-hosted the files.

The endgame however might be that I rewrite one or both of the games this year for #DOSCember .
