I spent most of this week at Butlins in Minehead without internet access, thus it has been a very sparse week of internet related content. Having no internet access was unexpected, Butlins has Wi-Fi available, and I brought my laptop with the intention of spending an hour writing in the evenings once having got both children down for bed.

Two things happened to cause my experienced internet blackout, firstly Butlins Wi-Fi lived up to its reputation of being terrible and while I had full bars of 4G (and sometimes even 5G) signal with three mobile, there was near zero internet access. I suspect this was caused by the volume of people on site and the communications infrastructure unable to cope, because on the last day after a number of people had left I finally got connected to Butlins Wi-Fi and my mobile internet began working again - on the last day.

Secondly, getting two small children on holiday to bed at anything but an unreasonable time is near impossible. I salute any parents able to continue their regular bedtime routine while on holiday. However, both our children where hyped up by the holiday experience. Therefore, we decided that taking them to the clubs until 10pm was preferable to their bouncing off the walls trying to get dressed and ready for bed. Thus, my laptop was brought, but never opened.

I didn't watch any YouTube, read any online articles or see anything cool from around the internet, but I _have_ survived our first holiday as a family.

## Joke of the week
_"When I was a kid, my dad got fired from his job as a road worker for theft. I refused to believe he could do such a thing, but when I got home, the signs were all there."_
