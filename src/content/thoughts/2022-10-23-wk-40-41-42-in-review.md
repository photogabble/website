I have been somewhat terrible at writing these week's in review. Normally I would have a number of links to share ready by Wednesday and an almost finished review done by Friday. Except here I am now with six weeks of reviews unfinished and little idea what happened during those weeks.

Where I am absolutely at a loss of what happened that week, or where one week had the links filled but the story missing and vice-versa for a subsequent week I have condensed them into a singular post, as with this one.

The reason for all this backlog is that I have been incredibly _busy_ with work and highly distracted by my Space Mines project (see [[PHP Space Mines: Introduction]].) The vast majority of my spare time has been spent [[Yak Shaving]] with [Soil Machine](https://github.com/weigert/SoilMachine); I have been porting it to PHP from C++ and learning a lot about its internals in the process, but not enough to actually get it to compile on my MacBook.

Aside from Space Mines and Soil Machine I also spent some time using Diffusion AI and created some interesting graphics for Space Mines with it. I'm still on the fence with this sort of art generation. It's an interesting technology but the sociologist in me feels it's increasingly problematic outside toy use.
