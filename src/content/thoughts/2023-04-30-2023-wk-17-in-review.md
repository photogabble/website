![[weekly-quote-36]]

I have spent the majority of my spare time this week working on my #SpaceMines game, an update for which is in the works. Outside of that I have been learning about using [SST](https://sst.dev/) as a simpler way of writing AWS deployment stacks.

With Space Mines I have been largely focused on its [[Space Mines, Design Language|design language]] and in doing so was re-introduced to #ThreeJS while researching procedural generation of landscape. I'll discuss more in a future post but as Space Mines is largely focused around maintaining a mining outpost I want the interface to be both visually interesting and functional while keeping a retro-future aesthetic.

My original plan was to have a 2D top down satellite view of the landscape with the players structures laid over that; with the whole thing being driven by something like [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) however, the more that I thought about it, the more having a 3D representation made sense. Especially after seeing how [Space nerds in space](http://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/) generated landscape in [earthlike.c](https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/82b3dba7f1ebf151902efa0d793633e81aa694d3/earthlike.c) and [crater.c](https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/blob/aa1ebfaf7967f2b8cb502d35def13a35951ef335/crater.c).
