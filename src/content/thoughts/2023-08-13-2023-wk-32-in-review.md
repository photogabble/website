After spending some time [[2023, Week 31 in Review|last week]], [[Server Setup, Hetzner-Moose|setting up a fresh Hetzner dedicated server]] I came to the realisation of why Hetzner didn't yet have official setup for Debian 11 (bullseye) - it's buggy on their hardware.

This week I spent some time researching alternatives to Hetzner. I knew that Hetzner were good value, but I didn't realise until I went looking for similar elsewhere *how* good value they are. I could not find an alternative for the same price without sacrificing something!

I have since decided to wait until Hetzner do officially support Debian 11; while I had wanted to get a new server set up quickly there really isn't much of a rush and I would rather stay with Hetzner.
