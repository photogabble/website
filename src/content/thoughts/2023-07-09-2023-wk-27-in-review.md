![[weekly-quote-46]]

This week has been spent between the postmortem of a huge deployment at work and my [[Rebuild The Kabal Invasion|rebuilding of The Kabal Invasion]] project. While working on rebuilding TKI I stumbled upon ![[ Steem Nova ]] a rebuild of ![[ 2Moons ]]. The game has similarities to TKI which itself is a fork of ![[ BlackNova Traders ]]; except unlike TKI and BNT in Steem Nova the player remains on a planet, and sends fleets of ships to explore the universe and do their bidding at distance.

One thing I do enjoy about finding source code of these games is seeing how different programmers solved the same or similar problems; they are also great sources of inspiration for game mechanics that I might want to include in future games.
