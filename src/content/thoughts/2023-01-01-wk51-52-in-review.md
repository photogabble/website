This is going to be a rather short week in review because I haven't touched my computer in two weeks. Instead I have had a carpenter come and help complete some tasks on the garden office I had built; mostly the things I couldn't find time to do myself such as the skirting. They should be back again in a few days to install my new custom desk which will be nice.

I hope you all have a good Christmas and a Happy New Year. Lets see if I can make this website a success in 2023 through posting content that's both unique and interesting.
