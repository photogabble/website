Having spent the majority of my free time last week building a windowing system based upon the Win32 API I rediscovered an old [C++ City Simulator tutorial by Emily Mansfield](https://github.com/EmilyMansfield/citybuilder) that I had started following eight years ago (seems November has a _theme..._) initially in C++ and then porting it to Golang. This time around I thought I would port it to TypeScript so that I might use its engine with last weeks Windows98 interface to produce something novel.

{% figure "/img/ts-city-simulator-spritesheet-editor.png", "A Windows 9x themed Sprite Editor anyone?", "Windows98 themed window showing a tile sheet on the left and the ability to select tiles and define their properties using fields on the right" %}

I quickly ran into performance issues with drawing too many sprites, I managed to optimise my rendering code back to getting close to 60fps, but it vastly dropped off when I began making the map bigger. I might revisit this in the future and refactor it to use an already optimal graphics library so that I can just focus on the gameplay.

Due to the aforementioned issues, I finished the week adding a Sprite Editor (_as shown above_) to the windowing system I had programmed last week; this was to aid using a sprite sheet I had bought.

Aside from the above [[hyper focus]], this week has been super busy and I honestly didn't have much time to watch videos or read exciting articles. Thus, the below is rather sparse.
