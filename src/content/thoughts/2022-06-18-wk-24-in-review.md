This week I have been focusing my personal time on my Moon Miner project and professional time developing a static website using the 11ty plugin [Slinkity](https://slinkity.dev/).

The Moon Miner project is something I have been quietly working on in the background for a large portion of this year, however not all in one constant project. Instead, I had a few false starts building it with [Next](https://nextjs.org/), then [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), then Nuxt in a [Lerna Monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), then [Golang](https://go.dev/) before finally circling back to its current and _final_ iteration as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) + [JetStream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) + [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) project.

I will write more in a separate post on my thoughts around the traditional monolith, suffice to say I have warmed back up to it and working with Laravel 9 + PHP 8.1 + Vue3 is such a nice experience that I don't want to use anything else.
