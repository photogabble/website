This is day twenty-five of my attempt to write something, anything, every day for 365 days in a row; currently 6.85% complete with a three-day streak.

Today I watched [Splattercat Gaming's video on Travellers Rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqgCm92AU_w) an open world, Medieval Innkeeper RPG sandbox that is similar to games like [[Stardew Valley on Steam|Stardew Valley]] and [[Graveyard Keeper on Steam|Graveyard Keeper]] in both art style and mechanics.

I enjoy Stardew Valley because it reminds me of Harvest Moon, a game I have poured hundreds of hours into on my Game Boy and Graveyard Keeper is essentially the same mechanics with a different occupation. I have yet to play Travellers Rest but all these games share a similar mechanic, all are *"grindy games"*.

What I mean by *grindy* is that you, the player have to build, craft, grow and otherwise manufacture items needed to progress in the game; with the mechanic balanced by the addition of automation and progressive increases in efficiency so that its *grindy* but not a **grind**.

As a result of Splattercat's video I bought [[Travellers Rest on Steam|Travellers Rest]] and will be giving it an hour or so play through tonight.
