    Taleb introduces the Hayekian and almost taoistic metaphor of the anti-library: A library of the books you haven't read, of the things you don't know. A massive collection of unknowledge, the anti-library contains all the books that may still change your life.
{% endblockquote %}

Inspired by [Maggie Appleton's Antilibrary](https://maggieappleton.com/antilibrary) and my general magpie tendency to collect things I added this list of books that I like the idea of reading.

Whenever I am out and find a book that I like the idea of reading, instead of bringing it home to my full bookcases I instead add it to my [bookwyrm.social profile](https://bookwyrm.social/user/carbontwelve) where it automatically makes its way to this page.
