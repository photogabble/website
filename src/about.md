I'm a "full stack" web developer from the UK currently building interesting things with Vue.js, PHP, Golang and Node.

I started playing with computers on an old Toshiba 386 luggable in the mid-nineties and have since been making websites for about 21 years.

My interests include macro photography, vintage computing, astrophysics and game development. I enjoy combining my interests, for example: developing a game for MS-DOS in the C programming language so that I can run it on [[Toshiba T1200|the 8086 computer I bought on eBay on a whim]].

## Photography
I have a keen interest in photography, especially Macro, Micro and Landscape photography. Early on in my career between 2008 and 2012 I did Product, Wedding and Event photography professionally. Unfortunately all my photography from that time is locked away on hard drives I have since put in storage. If I ever do get round to digging them out again I will link from here to a gallery of my selected favourites.

I used to rock a 5D MkII and a 7D MkI with a selection of glass that would impress most photography enthusiasts. Nowadays, I find my iPhone to be good enough for the pot shots I make on a daily basis supplemented with a Canon 70D and 40mm prime lens for family photographs.

## Folding@Home

[![Folding @ Home](https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/sigs/sigimage.php?u=666633&t=35947)](https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/user_summary.php?s=&u=666633)

For about six years staring from November 2014 I donated spare CPU cycles of computers I used to [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org) this was largely facilitated through the Folding@Home NaCL web client.

Unfortunately the NaCL client was retired in part due to <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/goodbye-pnacl-hello-webassembly.html">Google deprecating NaCL</a> and while during it's six year lifespan, the NaCl client contributed 48 million Folding@home work units towards the study of human diseases; the only alternatives to date are installed clients that operate natively.

My desktop computer has been packed away since the birth of our second child, and I don't feel comfortable pushing a heavy thermal load onto my laptop, therefore I haven't been able to contribute any folding cores in just over two years. I do hope to be able to do so again in the future.

## Inspiration
Over the years I have drawn inspiration from many individuals who through their activities have make me want to grow and improve. A handful whom immediately jump to mind are the following:
