For the longest time I constrained my writing to a handful of categories: [Programming](/topic/programming/), [Games](/topic/games/), [Tutorials](/tutorials/), [Blogging](/topic/blogging/), [Tools & Resources](/topic/tools-and-resources/) and [Pixel Art](/topic/pixel-art/). When converting PhotoGabble into a [[Digital Garden]] I decided to drop that restriction and allow a variety of topics to be discussed.
