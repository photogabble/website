When I first added this page to my website I had intended to read at least 12 books a year, in the several years since I have yet to hit that number in total.

Doh!

This books page layout was inspired by the books pages of [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/), [Mark Llobrera](https://www.markllobrera.com/reading/years/2020/), [SÃ¸ren Birkemeyer](https://annualbeta.com/bookshelf/) and [Derek Shirk](https://derekshirk.com/reads/). I originally got the idea for a books page from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/library) and her Antilibrary. The first version of this page was inspired by [Cox Chapman's Books page](https://www.coxchapman.com/books).
