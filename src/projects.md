Over the past few decades I have managed to collect an ever-growing pile of personal projects which are now distributed across several organisations on GitHub with the most notable being:
- [@carbonwelve (115 repositories)](https://github.com/carbontwelve?tab=repositories), a lot of these are small toy projects where I have tinkered with an idea or technology and then abandoned it
- [photogabble (62 repositories)](https://github.com/orgs/photogabble/repositories), the majority of these are in active development (albeit slow). I'm proud of most of the code here
- [tapestry-cloud (12 repositories)](https://github.com/orgs/tapestry-cloud/repositories), gets an honorable mention as the first massive personal project that I worked on. If I didn't enjoy using 11ty as much as I do, I would restart working on Tapestry
