The intention behind notes categorised as _thoughts_ is that they are supposed to be short, easy reads of 500 words or fewer that can be read within five to eight minutes.

This section has somewhat been taken over by my [Weeks in Review](/topic/week-in-review/) but also plays host to my #365DayProject.
