This connection graph takes its roots from the <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian.md</a> writing app. Using data provided by the [[Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin|@photogabble/interlinker]] plugin it's able to generate a node graph showing the *connectedness* of every page of this website.

It contains xxx nodes connected by x edges. xx% of pages on this website connect to another internal page. For more *interesting* statistics, why not visit the <a href="/stats/">stats page</a>.
