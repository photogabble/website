Inspired by Maggie's _Six Patterns of Gardening_ from her essay: [[ A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden ]], I added growth stages to this Digital Garden as a way of describing how polished I consider a piece of writing. 

Within that essay Maggie talks about _imperfection and learning in public_ which is something that resonated with me. For a number of years now I have been an advocate of #BuildInPublic to the point where the majority of the projects I work on are open source.

I have always considered PhotoGabble to be a place where I publish my musings and various tinkering for the world to purview if it wants, that lends it to be more of a Digital Garden than blog. I will still have [[Ephemeral]] notes in the form of journal entries and development logs, but I am enjoying cultivating this growing collection of notes.

When I first converted this website into a Digital Garden in 2023 I borrowed Maggie's horticultural metaphors for indicating how _"done"_ content is:

- ðŸŒ± _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
- ðŸŒ¿ _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified
- ðŸŒ³ _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete

Over time, I added two more to that list: [[Stubs]] as placeholders for content coming _"soon"_ and [[Ephemeral]] for point in time updates that will likely not be updated such as Journal entries.
