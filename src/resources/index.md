A few years ago I stumbled upon [Winnie Lim's Library](https://winnielim.org/library/) containing their collections and resources. I liked the concept and was inspired to create both here as [lists](/lists/) and this resources section.

So far the majority of my resources have been _bookmarked_ links, but they can be anything that Iâ€™ve learned something from. I have curated some resources into various themed collections such as [the Antilibrary](/antilibrary/) and my collection of [forums and communities](/lists/forum/).
