While exploring [Winnie Lim's Library](https://winnielim.org/library/) I noticed that on a lot of their resources they had _"highlights"_; these are extracts from a resource such as quotes from a book. At the time I wanted to replicate that functionality within PhotoGabble which was going through a transformation into becoming a [[Digital Garden]].

Ultimately[^1], while I wrote _an_ implementation. I have yet to read enough of my reading list to grow this section into the list of references I had envisioned, and instead it has become a container stuffed with quotes for my [Week In Review](/topic/week-in-review/) project.
