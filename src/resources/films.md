The English language has many hypernyms, for example, you can use _sports_ to refer to rugby, a cycle race or competitive fishing. However, I am unaware of there existing one that encompasses both Movies and Television Shows.

This _thought_ came into my head while trying to name this category of resource in my digital garden. I eventually settled upon _films_ even though most things are shot on digital now and while the word _film_ connotes Movies to most I had to settle on something and words such as _media_ and _video_ felt too broad.
