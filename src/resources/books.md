I have a fondness for books, so much so that if I had the space my inner bibliophile would gush over creating a private library with wood paneled walls and ten feet tall bookshelves. Alas, I do not have the space, nor the resource to make that dream a reality.

This books resource page lists books that I physically own, some of which I have actually read _and_ reviewed. Read items in this collection are linked to from [my bookshelf](/books/). For a more complete list of books I would like to own (or own but have yet to compile notes on) visit [The Antilibrary](/antilibrary/).
